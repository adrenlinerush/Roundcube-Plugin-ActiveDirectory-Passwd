Based on JohnDoh's SQL plugin: http://github.com/JohnDoh/RoundCube-Plugin-Changepasswd-SQL/tree/master

Creates a web request designed to work with my passwdChangeAD script to change passwords in Active directory

passwdChangeAD needs to be tested working and debug turned off or this plugin will not recieve the return codes

tested and working but still needs polishing

Requires that you run the svn/trunk version of Roundcube...

Installation:
-----------------
create a folder under plugins named changepasswd_AD and put all the files and folders in there

add passwdchange_AD to the enabled plugins in the main config file

edit the config file to liking

place the roundcube fail and success files in the passwdChangeAD directory

and should be good to go
